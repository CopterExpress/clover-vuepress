Electromotive force. Ohm&#39;s Law</h2><p>As we know, all bodies are composed of tiny particles - molecules, molecules are composed of atoms, atoms \u2014 of still smaller protons, neutrons, and electrons. Each particle, molecule, or body has its energy charge. Bodies with a positive (+) charge are attracted to bodies with a negative (-) charge, and the same charges repel from each other ( + ) from ( + ) and ( - ) from ( - ). Motion is observed.</p><p>The intensity of this motion of particles in the substance depends on many factors: deformation, the effect of light, heating, friction, chemical reactions.</p><p>With that, small sources of two polarities (+) and (-) are formed. Each polarity he has its own value \u2014 the potential. The more the polarity, the more the difference between (+) and (-).</p><p>Therefore, this difference of potentials (+) and (-) is the electromotive force (further referred to as EMF), i.e., electric voltage.</p><p><img src="'+o+'" alt="current"></p><p>Thus, the source of electric power has difference of potentials, the charged particles of which attract to each other. There are also phenomena that restrict their motion.</p><p>The first are conductors which are most metals, water, acids, alkali, etc.. The second are dielectrics, such as wood, air, plastics, etc. Good dielectrics, such as porcelain, glass, PCB, rubber, etc., are used for making insulators. Copper, aluminum, brass, bronze, silver, gold, and their alloys are used as conductors of electricity. If two poles of the power source are connected with piece of conductor, charged particles will start moving from (+) to (-).</p><p>This motion is electric current.</p><p>Each body can resist the motion of charged particles (electric current). This property depends on the substance that the body consists of, and is called resistance. Conductors have low resistance, while dielectrics have high resistance. Conductors have their own resistance, which is called the inner resistance of the source. The current flowing in the circuit will depend on the difference of potentials (remember that the more the difference, the stronger attraction) and on resistance of the conductor and the internal resistance of the power source; as a rule, the inner resistance of the power source is very low and maybe neglected.</p><p>The dependence is as follows:</p><p>The electric current will be equal to the one obtained by dividing the difference of potentials at the section (the voltage) by the resistance of this section (resistance). Let&#39;s denote electric current as I, voltage as U, and resistance as R;</p><p><img src="'+r+'" alt="current"></p><p>Using a triangle, working with the formula of the Ohm&#39;s law, it is easy to write a formula for any input value.</p><p><img src="'+i+'" alt="current"></p><p>You should cover the value to be found. If the two remaining values are at the same level, they are to be multiplied by each other.

The points where several conductors connect are called nodes, and the sections that connect two adjacent nodes are called branches.</p><p>In a closed electrical circuit, electric charge cannot accumulate at any point, as this would cause a change of potentials at points of the circuit. Therefore, all electric charges coming to a node in a unit of time are equal to the charges exiting the same node in a unit of time.</p><p>A branched circuit.</p><p>At node A, the circuit divides into four branches which connect at node B.</p><p>Let us denote the currents in the non-branched part of the circuit as I, and in the branches \u2014 as <strong>I1, I2, I3, I4,</strong> respectively.</p><p>In such a circuit, these currents will have the following ratio:</p><p><strong>I = I1+I2+I3+I4;</strong></p><p><img src="'+n+'" alt="current"></p><p>The sum of currents coming to a node in an electric circuit is equal to the sum of the currents leaving this node.</p><p><img src="'+s+'" alt="current"></p><p>In case of resistors parallel connection, the current passes in four directions, which reduces the overall resistance, or increases the overall conductivity of the circuit, which is equal to the sum of branches&#39; conductivities.</p><p>Let us denote the current in an unbranched circuit as I. The currents in separate branches \u2014 as I1, I2, I3, and I4, respectively. The voltage between points A and B is U. The total resistance between these points is R</p><p>According to Ohm&#39;s law, let&#39;s write:</p><p><strong>I = U/R; I1 = U/R1; I2 = U/R2; I3 = U/R3; I4 = U/R4;</strong></p><p>According to the first Kirchhoff&#39;s law:</p><p><strong>I = I1+I2+I3+I4; or U/R = U/R1+U/R2+U/R3+U/R4.</strong></p><p>By reducing both parts of the obtained equation by U, we will get:</p><p><strong>1/R = 1/R1+1/R2+1/R3+1/R4</strong>, which was to be proved.</p><p>The ratio for any number of parallel-connected resistors. If a circuit contains two parallel-connected resistors <strong>R1</strong> and <strong>R2</strong>, we can write the following equation:</p><p><strong>1/R =1/R1+1/R2;</strong></p><p>From this equation, we find resistance R, which can be replaced by two parallel-connected resistors:</p><p><img src="'+a+'" alt="current"></p><p>The obtained expression is of wide practical use.

Any motion that overcomes resistance, requires a certain amount of energy. For example, to move any body, frictional resistance is to be overcome and the work used for it in transformed into heat.</p><p>Electric resistance of the conductor acts the same way as frictional resistance. Thus, to conduct the current through a conductor, the current source spends some energy, which is converted into heat.</p><p>Conversion of electric energy into thermal energy is reflected by the Joule-Lenz&#39;s law, or the law of the Joule effect.</p><p>Russian scientist Lenz and English physicist Joule simultaneously and independently found that when current passes through a conductor, the amount of heat generated by the conductor is directly proportional to the current squared, the resistance of the conductor and the duration of the period when the electric current passed through the conductor.

It said that electricity defies mathematical description, since electricity is own anger, your own eruption of a body; own angry Self, which manifests itself in each irritated body. The rector of the Berlin University in those years was Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel.</p><p>Ohm&#39;s mane has been immortalized not only by the law that he had discovered. In 1881, at the Electrical Congress in Paris, the name of the unit of resistance &quot;Ohm&quot; has been approved. Not everyone knows that one of the craters on the dark side of the Moon is named after Ohm, along with the names of great physicists such as Planck, Lorentz, Landau, and Kurchatov.</p><p>In 1833, Georg Ohm was already known in Germany, and was Professor of the Polytechnic school in Nuremberg. However, in France and England, Ohm&#39;s works remained unknown. 10 years after the appearance of Ohm&#39;s law, a French physicist in his experiments came to the same conclusions. However, it was pointed out to him that this law has been discovered by Ohm as early as in 1827. French schoolchildren still study the Ohm&#39;s law under a different name; for them, it is the Pouillet&#39;s law.</p>',73);function u(f,m){return p}var b=e(d,[["render",u],["__file","lesson2.html.vue"]]);export{b as default};
