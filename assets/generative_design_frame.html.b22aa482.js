It comes with a generative design feature. This makes it possible to create rule-driven designs. First the preserved geometry is defined. Usually this includes all kinds of mounts like motor mounts, flight controller mounts, RPi mount etc. Then obstacle geometry is defined. This for example includes space for the propellers and the airflow. After that forces are defined. Then Fusion 360 will automatically calculate optimal connections for the aforementioned preserved geometry.</p>',7),j=e("p",{float:"left"},[e("img",{src:l,width:"49%",class:"zoom"}),e("img",{src:c,width:"49%",class:"zoom"})],-1),z=a('<h3 id="prototypes" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#prototypes" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Prototypes</h3><h4 id="prototype-1" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#prototype-1" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Prototype 1</h4><p>After printing the first version of the frame we discovered the following problems:</p><ul><li>Bad Filament: Layer Adhesion of the Filament was quite bad resulting in a not very rigid model</li><li>Support Structure: The support structure for the frame is very complex and the parameters used in the slicer resulted in it being unable to be removed without destroying the model</li><li>Arm Strength: Some parts of the arms to the motor mounts were very thin, resulting in them breaking easily and removing the support structure resulted in breaking them</li></ul><p>To conquer those problems we made several changes. We increased the minimal thickness for the generated structures and generated a new model. We changed the settings in the slicer so that the support structure could be removed easier as well as changed the infill structure. Finally we changed the filament and increased the printing temperature. Further we concluded that printing with a water dissolvable support structure would be optimal, however as of right now we don\u2019t have access to a printer capable of that.</p><p><img src="'+p+'" alt="Prototype 1"></p><h4 id="prototype-2" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#prototype-2" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Prototype 2</h4>',7),W=t("This prototype took 48 hours of printing and used 277 grams of filament including 100 grams for the support.

We have also changed some of the forces on the points we observed breakings in our previous tests. We have also updated the prop guard to make it more stable and increased the area around the screws, so it would break harder. The frame without the prop guard weighs only 150g making it significantly lighter than the default frame.</p><p><img src="'+w+'" alt="final prototype"></p><h3 id="benefits" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#benefits" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Benefits</h3><p>We see the following benefits with our design over the traditional clover frame design:</p><ul><li>Tools needed for production: only a 3D printer is needed compared to laser cutter, cnc and 3D printer</li><li>Single material reduces supply chain complexity and reduces cost. Filament is cheap and only around 400 grams are needed for the full frame and the prop guard. This should reduce the cost to under $5.</li><li>The unibody design saves weight and much less screws are needed. This also reduces costs.</li><li>Easier adaptability: Anybody can change the frame to their desire and include their own adapters and mounts. It can be printed by any standard sized 3D printer.

By utilizing state of the art methods of CAD programs we are able to optimize the weight and shape of drone frames in a way that for the first time it is feasible to 3D print them. In total we have printed around 10 frames and presented a few of them above and the challenges we faced with them. This iterative process to frame design was only possible due to the fact that only a 3D printer is needed and the filament being very cheap. Due to the open source nature of the project and this report giving a short introduction into generative design, we hope that many people feel inspired to check out this new method of designing and producing drone frames.</p><h3 id="cad-files" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#cad-files" aria-hidden="true">#</a> CAD Files</h3>',9),R=t("You are welcome to test out these frame yourself and you are free to modify them in any way, shape or form.
