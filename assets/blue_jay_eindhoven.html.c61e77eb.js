This is done since it was noted that this is not done in the base version of the drone. The path planning algorithm makes it possible that the drone flies autonomous in a much better way than without the algorithm.</p><p>In the documentation, we have set up a plan to put this path planning algorithm to work on your drone. This is a low level algorithm, so everyone should be able to implement it. The algorithm does however need some sort of map from which it can get information on the possible paths. So that part, you still have to implement yourselves.</p><h2 id="hardware-research" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#hardware-research" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Hardware Research</h2><p>The report describes the internship project carried out at Blue Jay. As we focus on indoor drone application, we wishes to minimize the produced noise to improve user experiences. On the other hand, we also wish to improve the flying efficiency for benefiting flying time. As result, the project is about making the drone more efficient with less noise emitted during the operation. For producing design to approach the problem, design methodology has been applied. In the end the ducted fan design has been chosen through studied theory and experimenting. However, there are two additional requirements, an increase in amounts of sensors and an increase in propeller numbers to increase safety. These additional requirements result the drone has less flying time due to the increase in weight. However, the selected design still improved the efficiency of selected propeller.</p><p>This hardware part is more of a general research that can be applied to all drones, including the Clover drone. If a group of high school or university students would like to do their own research on the Clover drone, they can use the research for ideas. They can for instance perform a project in which they design their own 3D printed ducted fans to use on the Clover drone. The research in the report would then be a good first read on how to design such a thing and what the performance results could be.</p><p>In addition, the kind of propellers that are used on the Clover drone can also be adjusted. Maybe a group wants get a little smaller or larger propellers or even a different shape. The research done can then also help as a guide to decide what kind would be best for that specific use with respect to size and shape.</p><p>It is also useful when one wants to use the code that the Clover drone uses, but also wants to develop their own drone. The hardware research can then be used as a guide on how you can do this. It states all kind of factors that should be taken into account and in what way you can do this.</p><h2 id="full-project-information" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#full-project-information" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Full Project Information</h2>',9),W=t("To see what our project at Blue Jay is all about, you can watch the following video of our interim event: "),E={href:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_8TTQN92pU&t=0s",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},B=t("https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_8TTQN92pU&t=0s"),F=t(".
